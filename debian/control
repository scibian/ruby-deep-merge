Description: recursively merge Hash elements in Ruby
 Deep Merge is a simple set of utility functions for Ruby hashes. It allows
 merging elements inside a hash together recursively. Since there is no
 standard for this, the merging is done in an arbitrary way, but should end
 up being pretty intuitive and do what is expected.
